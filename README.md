# Technical-classes-UPES

This repository contains all the Data Structures and Algorithms (DSA) questions given by our technical teacher.  
Each question is solved in either  C++ or Java.

The purpose of this repository is to keep a record of all assignments and 
practice problems given in class, and to make it easier to revise later.

All codes are written and maintained by Parth Garg.
